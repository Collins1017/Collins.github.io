			<p>As legend has it, the iconic sneaker series almost never lifted off. Soon after Michael Jordan 
			debuted the Air Jordan I, the NBA stepped in and banned the shoe because they featured "non-regulation" 
			colors. Suffice it to say, Jordan didn't listen and thusly, the great basketball shoe boom began.</p>
			
			<p>Now we look at each and every pair of Air Jordan shoes released by Nike, a total of 31 in all 
			(not counting variations). Next to each pair is Nike's motto for the shoe (if any) and the year in 
			which they debuted.</p>
